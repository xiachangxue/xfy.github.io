ABSTRACT = {Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, attributed to its powerful feature extraction capabilities. However, existing methods face several challenges: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling long-range spectral dependencies because of their limited receptive fields; Transformers are constrained by their quadratic computational complexity; and Mamba-based methods fail to fully exploit spatial–spectral interactions when handling high-dimensional HSI data. To address these limitations, we propose MRFP-Mamba, a novel Multi-Receptive-Field Parallel Mamba architecture that integrates hierarchical spatial feature extraction with efficient modeling of spatial–spectral dependencies. The proposed MRFP-Mamba introduces two key innovation modules: (1) A multi-receptive-field convolutional module employing parallel 1×1, 3×3, 5×5, and 7×7 kernels to capture fine-to-coarse spatial features, thereby improving discriminability for multi-scale objects; and (2) a parameter-optimized Vision Mamba branch that models global spatial–spectral relationships through structured state space mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MRFP-Mamba consistently surpasses existing CNN-, Transformer-, and state space model (SSM)-based approaches across four widely used hyperspectral image (HSI) benchmark datasets: PaviaU, Indian Pines, Houston 2013, and WHU-Hi-LongKou. Compared with MambaHSI, our MRFP-Mamba achieves improvements in Overall Accuracy (OA) by 0.69%, 0.30%, 0.40%, and 0.97%, respectively, thereby validating its superior classification capability and robustness.},
