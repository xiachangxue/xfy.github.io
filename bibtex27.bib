ABSTRACT = {Deep learning has demonstrated significant success in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification by effectively leveraging spatial–spectral feature learning. However, current approaches encounter three challenges: (1) high spectral redundancy and the presence of noisy bands, which impair the extraction of discriminative features; (2) limited spatial receptive fields inherent in convolutional operations; and (3) unidirectional context modeling that inadequately captures bidirectional dependencies in non-causal HSI data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HG-Mamba, a novel hybrid geometry-aware bidirectional Mamba network for HSI classification. The proposed HG-Mamba synergistically integrates convolutional operations, geometry-aware filtering, and bidirectional state-space models (SSMs) to achieve robust spectral–spatial representation learning. The proposed framework comprises two stages. The first stage, termed spectral compression and discrimination enhancement, employs multi-scale spectral convolutions alongside a spectral bidirectional Mamba (SeBM) module to suppress redundant bands while modeling long-range spectral dependencies. The second stage, designated spatial structure perception and context modeling, incorporates a Gaussian Distance Decay (GDD) mechanism to adaptively reweight spatial neighbors based on geometric distances, coupled with a spatial bidirectional Mamba (SaBM) module for comprehensive global context modeling. The GDD mechanism facilitates boundary-aware feature extraction by prioritizing spatially proximate pixels, while the bidirectional SSMs mitigate unidirectional bias through parallel forward–backward state transitions. Extensiveexperiments on the Indian Pines, Houston2013, and WHU-Hi-LongKou datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HG-Mamba, achieving overall accuracies of 94.91%, 98.41%, and 98.67%, respectively.},
